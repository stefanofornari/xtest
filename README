RELEASE NOTES
=============

1. v3.x breaks backward compatibility to address the new mechanisms of
   preventing the use of internal APIs introduced with JDK9.
   This involved the following xtest packages

   - ste.xtest.awt
   - ste.xtest.net

   If you need to use those packages without changes, use v2.x and JDK8

   The following classes have been removed and will not be longer supported:

   - ste.xtest.reflect.CodeInjector

2. To be able to easily using URL stubbing in other projects all relevan
   classes have been taken from JDK's source code and relocated under
   the package ste.xtest.net. In this way the stubs will not use any more
   internal classes but normal packages.

3. Note that Java 17 deprecated SecurityManager and setting a SM into a JVM.
   Trying to replace the SM throws the exception

   java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: The Security Manager is deprecated and will be removed in a future release

   This impacts ste.xtest.cli.BugFreeCLI, which uses such functionality behind
   the scene to determine the exist status of the process. This indeed means
   that if BugFreeCLI is used with Java 18 or earlier, test will fail with above
   exception.
   The only workaround available at the moment is to set -Djava.security.manager=allow
   when running the tests:

    <project>
      [...]
      <build>
        <plugins>
          <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.5.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <!--
                  java.security.manager must be set on the command line of
                  the forked VM, it cannot be set after the VM has been started
                -->
                <argLine>-Djava.security.manager=allow</argLine>
            </configuration>
          </plugin>
        </plugins>
      </build>
      [...]
    </project>
