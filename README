RELEASE NOTES
=============

1. v3.x breaks backward compatibility to address the new mechanisms of 
   preventing the use of internal APIs introduced with JDK9.
   This involved the following xtest packages
   
   - ste.xtest.awt
   - ste.xtest.net

   If you need to use those packages without changes, use v2.x and JDK8

   The following classes have been removed and will not be longer supported:

   - ste.xtest.reflect.CodeInjector
   
 1. To be able to easily using URL stubbing in other projects all relevan 
   classes have been taken from JDK's source code and relocated under
   the package ste.xtest.net. In this way the stubs will not use any more
   internal classes but normal packages.
